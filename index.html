<h1>For a Woman Worth Everything</h1>
<p>Twas an arid night like any other<br>
The fallen dew fouled the air like cannon fodder<br>
When solemn winds stirred passive thoughts<br>
And menacing gusts made me shudder<br>
There was a cozy warmth I was soon to know<br>
An enchanting gaze I could only follow. . .<br>

With foggy mist still on my brow<br>
And as the personification of the ailing word, “wow!"<br>
I asked a homely schelling:<br>
“what gets you going”<br>
</p>

<p>Soon I walked an exhilarating path<br>
Amidst the fortunes of cause and wrath<br>
As the clouds thundered glum<br>
I knew a light fuzzy and warm<br>
As the crescent moon its final glow<br>
Came a mirthy smile, <br>

<p>
And am I lucky I walked<br>
Soon I found mirth<br>
And a charm that’s equal parts<br>
Lovely and equal parts goofball<br>
