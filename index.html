<h1>For a Woman Worth Everything</h1>
<p>Twas an arid night like any other<br>
The fallen dew fouled the air like cannon fodder<br>
When solemn winds stirred passive thoughts<br>
And menacing gusts made me shudder<br>
There was a cozy warmth I was soon to know<br>
An enchanting gaze I could only follow. . .<br>

With foggy mist still on my brow<br>
And as the personification of the ailing word, “wow!"<br>
I asked a homely schelling:<br>
“what gets you going:”<br>

</p>

<p>Soon I walked an exhilarating path<br>
Amidst the fortunes of cause and wrath<br>
As the clouds thundered glum<br>
I knew a light fuzzy and warm<br>
As the crescent moon its final glow<br>
Came a mirth-y smile in my heart sown <br>

<p>
I am lucky this path I walked<br>
For while the road occasionally forked<br>
In its essence I found reason and rhyme<br>
As the soulless bask in infinite time<br>
We found grace in fleeting memory<br>
And since forever is not my luxury<br>
I basked in my found glee<br>
And a charm that’s equal parts<br>
Lovely and equal parts goofball<br>

<p>
Herein lies my “thank you”<br>
For the countless laughs<br>
Thank you<br>
For your company and half<br>
Through existential angst<br>
Thank you<br>
For coloring my seams<br>
Thank you<br>
For your nuanced whim<br>
Thank you<br>
</p>

In all I am grateful for getting to know you, for the memories we made, that I’ll hold dear, for the night at the gym, for your odyssey from India, for the day you were born. For that day serves as the harbinger of this indelible experience.
SO, here’s to the day the universe was graced by your birth: Happy birthday!!
I will you many many more of these celebrations.
